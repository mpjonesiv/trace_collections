# trace_collections

The trace_collections repository houses the scripts and conversion files for publishing the Trace journal special collections. The original files are written in Pandoc flavored Markdown: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html

Pandoc is also used for file conversions from submissions provided in Microsoft DOC format, and for converting from the Markdown files to HTML, PDF, and EPUB.
